= ESMF SDK Python Aspect Model loader

The Python SDK offers functionality which helps software developers to work with Aspect Models in their Python applications.

This guide gives an overview of the components in the Python SDK and shows how to use them.

== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites

* Python Version 3.10 or higher.
Check your version with
+
[source,bash]
----
python --version
----

* In order to include the packages a Python dependency manager is required; we recommend
https://python-poetry.org/[Python Poetry].
The remainder of the guide assumes usage of Poetry.
Please refer to the https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation[Poetry installation guide].
You can check your installed Poetry version with
+
[source,bash]
----
poetry --version
----

== Aspect Model Loader for Python

=== Introduction

Aspect Models are stored as RDF Graphs in `.ttl` (RDF Turtle) files.
The Aspect Model Loader for Python reads one or more Turtle file and parses the Aspect Model.
The result is a Python object representing the root Aspect of the Aspect Model.
The Aspect has references to all of its children (e.g., Properties and Operations).

=== Installation

If you want to work with Aspect Models in your Python solution you should install the Aspect Model Loader for Python and include it into your project.

== Installation from package Repository

=== PyPI

Currently not available

=== GitHub Releases

To use GitHub release as dependency using Poetry, you need to add it like this:

[source,toml]
----
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
esmf-aspect-meta-model-python = { git = "https://github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-sdk-py-aspect-model-loader.git", tag = "1.0.0" }
----

for more information on depend on a library located in a git:
https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/#git-dependencies[git dependencies]


== Installation with local package

The Python package is an archive with the file ending `.tar.gz`.
If you are working with Poetry, you can easily import that package by adding the local reference to your `pyproject.toml`

[source,toml]
----
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
esmf-aspect-meta-model-python = { path = "path/to/esmf-aspect-meta-model-python-x.y.z.tar.gz" }
----

To make Poetry recognize your changes, run
[source,bash]

----
poetry update
----

=== Loading an Aspect Model

Import the Aspect Model loader in your Python module
[source,python]

----
from esmf-aspect-meta-model-python import AspectLoader
----

Then create an instance of the AspectLoader and run the method `load_aspect_model()` from the `AspectLoader` with

[source,python]
----
from esmf-aspect-meta-model-python import AspectLoader

al = AspectLoader()
aspect = al.load_aspect_model("path/to/turtle.ttl")
----

where the input argument can either be a `Path` object or a string representing a path.
Both, relative paths and absolute paths are allowed.

The return value of `load_aspect_model()` is an instance of the class `DefaultAspect` which is declared in the project.

==== Loading an Aspect Model from multiple files

If the Aspect Model is seperated into multiple `.ttl` files you can load the Aspect Model by calling the method `load_aspect_model_from_multiple_files` with a list of file paths.

[source,python]
----
from esmf-aspect-meta-model-python import AspectLoader

al = AspectLoader()
aspect = al.load_aspect_model_from_multiple_files(
    ["file1.ttl", "file2.ttl", "file3.ttl"]
)
----

It may happen that the multiple files contain multiple aspect definitions and not only one.
In this case it is possible to pass the URN of the Aspect as a hint, so the Loader knows which Aspect to load.

[source,python]
----
aspect_urn = "urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:test:1.0.0#myAspect"
aspect = al.load_aspect_model_from_multiple_files(
    ["file1.ttl", "file2.ttl", "file3.ttl"],
    aspect_urn
)
----

The urn can either be a string or an instance of rdflib.URIRef.
If no urn is passed and the `.ttl` files contain multiple Aspects, the Aspect Loader will load the first one that is found.

=== Traversing the Aspect Model

The attributes of an Aspect can be accessed with like this:

[source,python]
----
name = aspect.name
urn = aspect.urn
preferred_names = aspect.preferred_names
descriptions = aspect.descriptions
meta_model_version = aspect.meta_model_version
see = aspect.see

properties = aspect.properties
operations = aspect.operations
events = aspect.events
----

Note that the attributes on Aspect Model objects are read-only.

== SAMM Aspect Meta Model in Python

=== Introduction

The SAMM Aspect Meta Model is defined by multiple Turtle files in the public
https://github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-semantic-aspect-meta-model[ESMF GitHub Repository].
The project is developed in Java and the releases are published as JAR files.

Python applications that work with Aspect Models and RDF may need the SAMM as a Python package.
Therefore, the project `SAMM Aspect Meta Model` for Python was created.
It is set up to extract the RDF Turtle files from the released SAMM artifact or its Github repository and pack them into a Python project.

If you are not sure whether you need the SAMM Aspect Meta Model as a dependency you probably don't need it because it does not contain any Python functionality.
It is only intended for working with Aspect Models on RDF level.

=== Installation

The package is released on PyPI under the name `esmf-samm-aspect-meta-model`.
The package can be imported to a Python project by adding the package as a dependency.

If you are using Poetry as a dependency manager you can execute the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
poetry add samm-aspect-meta-model
poetry install
----

The `pyproject.toml` file of your project should then include the following:
[source,toml]

----
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
samm-aspect-meta-model = "^x.y.z"
----

In the future it is planned to publish all packages of the Python SDK on public repositories.
The authentication will then not be required anymore.
